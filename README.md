# CombatSim: Pusheen Power Clash!

Pusheen Power Clash is a cute, Old School RPG/Pokemon inspired and Dungeons and Dragons flavored Combat Sim that pits some cute characters in a battle to the death!

### Motivation

I've always been a gamer and big fan of RolePlayingGames, including tabletop games such as DnD and Pathfinder. This adorable game is a love letter to that retro-style turn based combat, and a small jab at the often overlooked brutality of Pokemon. As my first big project since joining the General Assembly SEI bootcamp, I couldn't miss the opportunity to return to my roots and create a game both lighthearted and action-based.
