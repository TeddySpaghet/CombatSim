# CombatSim: Pusheen Power Clash!

Pusheen Power Clash is a cute, Old School RPG/Pokemon inspired and Dungeons and Dragons flavored Combat Sim that pits some cute characters in a battle to the death!

### Motivation

I've always been a gamer and big fan of RolePlayingGames, including tabletop games such as DnD and Pathfinder. This adorable game is a love letter to that retro-style turn based combat, and a small jab at the often overlooked brutality of Pokemon. As my first big project since joining the General Assembly SEI bootcamp, I couldn't miss the opportunity to return to my roots and create a game both lighthearted and action-based.

### User Stories & Wireframes

To play the game, each player first selects a character. They then press the "Battle Start!" button and are taken into the battle screen. Each player then takes turns selecting the action they want, which serve to either damage their opponent or heal themselves (or both!). Once a player's character is dead, the remaining player is congratulated for winning the round and their score increases. At any point during or after the battle, the players have the option to click the "Start Over!" to return to the title screen and to choose different characters or start the fight anew.

### Future Development

After reformatting the code for better performance and readability, I plan to implement popup boxes when hovering above the characters and their actions which will act as descriptors. I also plan to implement an imput field where you can name your Pusheens to allow for an even more engaging user experience. Furthermore, I will implement deeper mechanics with the use of a turn timer, notably statuses such as damage over time as well as buffs and debuffs.
